        <h3>ViewFinder App</h3>
        <p>
          For this project, I was instructed to create a fictitious app that could be useful in one’s daily life. I decided to create an app for photographers. This app allows photographers to find new photoshoot locations with the map within the app and make connections with other photographers. For the design of the logo, I created the shape of a viewfinder on a camera and added a map inside. The app theme was very fun and “creative,” like photographers, so I wanted to capture that within the logo as well.

       <h3>Sleep Health Foundation Campaign</h3>
        <p>For this project, I was placed with a group of other student graphic designers, and we had to create a sleep campaign for the Sleep Health Foundation. Over the course of the semester we created all kinds of advertisements from branding, posters, social media posts, and even an app. One of my duties for the team was to create a logo. This is our secondary logo. I used the “H” within “SHF” and turned it into a bed with a pillow and blanket.

        <h3>CLT Donut Festival</h3>
        <p>For this project, I was instructed to create a social media post for the CLT Donut Festival. Upon research, their branding colors were pink and blue, and their overall theme was fun. So, I wanted to capture this same theme within the social media post. I kept the main colors from the logo, pink and blue. I wanted the typography to catch one’s eye as well, so I used a bold but fun font to grab the attention of the reader. Lastly, I added a donut that was bitten to add to that fun feel.<p>

       <h3>HealthNext Conference</h3>
        <p>For this project, I had to create branding and advertisements for a fictitious conference. I chose the HealthNext Conference. The entire conference is based on making connections with other healthcare professionals and learning new innovations in the healthcare field, so I considered both of these when designing this ad. At a quick glance, I wanted people to be able to get an idea of what this event was. So, I have “2024 conference” in big bold wording, along with the date and time. I also pictured the speakers in all black and white so it look cohesive, color-wise, with the branding.<p>

       <h3>Score Corner Campaign</h3>
        <p>For this project, I was instructed to make a social media campaign for a company. I created “Score Corner,” which is a sporting goods store. I wanted the branding to really stand out so that, at a quick glance, viewers will know what company posted this. So, I made the colors stand out, and the image effects also look cohesive with the other ads in the campaign.

        <h3>Copper Sunset Tshirt Design</h3>
        <p>For this project, I was given the creative freedom to create a t-shirt design for any fictitious band we wanted. I came up with an Indie Fold band called “Copper Sunset”. After lots of sketching and research, I knew I wanted to feature a guitar somehow. I decided to lay a guitar horizontally to mimic an image of mountains and a sunset reflecting off of the water, but instead of mountains, it is the shape of the guitar.<p>

        <h3>William B. Umstead Park Digital Illustration Contest</h3>
        <p>For this project, William B. Umstead Park held a contest for designers to create a digital illustration of what they think represents the park. My professor wanted us to participate. When you look up images of the park, this bridge is often pictured, so I knew I wanted to capture it in my design. I also know it is popular to camp, so I did a nighttime illustration that can be pictured both.

        <h3>Water Lillies</h3>
        <p>For this project, I was instructed to take a famous painting and replicate it digitally with shapes. Because of the colors and the fact that the brush strokes are visible, I decided to do “Water Lillies 1919” by Claude Monet. For this project, I used different-sized rectangles and triangles. The use of shapes gives this painting an abstract feel. <p>

      <h3>Around The House Techniques</h3>
      <p>For this photography project, I was instructed to use photography techniques to capture images “around the house.” The first image pictures my dog being framed by the car window. The other two images use the rule of thirds.

    <h3>Patterns</h3>
    <p>For this photography project, I had to photograph patterns. Around my home, there were lots of patterns, but these stood out to me the most. Repetition is a great way to grab a viewer’s attention, and all three of these images represent that well.
